                    <br>In order to build this site, I went from sketches, to wireframes, to beta testing, to live. <br>
                    <br>As you can see, I made a few changes from sketch to final product. Some of these changes were because I wanted to prioritize
                    getting this project done over telling a perfect story (see the graphic design page sketch to the left) and some were because
                    following the wireframe stage, I realized that a sketch wouldn't look as good on-screen as they did in my proposal. The wireframe below, 
                    for example, didn't read very well in practice.

                    In the fall of 2020, <br>
                    <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/morgan-louis/" style="color: #6dc661;">Morgan Louis</a> and I worked together to 
                    create a keyboard for people who are partly paralyzed. The idea was that a classic WASD keyboard is optimized for typing, but what if you couldn’t type at all? What if you could only communicate by scanning a keyboard? Tools already exist to communicate using glyphs or the like, so we wanted to focus on a system that used letters. 
                    <br><br>We considered two main things when changing the layout of the keyboard- first, that the eyes would have to scan less space, and second, that letters that are more commonly accessed in the English language would move towards the center of the board. 
                    <br><br>The document here includes more information like where the idea arose from, the specific groups of people we wanted to target, our long-term business plan, etc. 
                    <br><br>I took a break from working on this project, but it’s still in progress! In fact, you'll be able to access a prototype here soon.
