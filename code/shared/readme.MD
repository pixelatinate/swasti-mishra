# Shared Resource Directory
This is where you may want to put shared resources across all labs, including libraries you create or models you download.

You are free to not use this directory, although you can save yourself some disk space by consolidating shared files here.

I would recommend leaving all lab-specific files in each lab#/step#/ directory and putting Object/Texture files here. As an example I have placed the StarterCode js here.

If you choose to modify the js contents within the shared directory, make sure ALL of your labs continue to work with the modifications made.
For this reason, it may be easier to just copy all js files to the local lab#/step# repo.
